Welcome to My GitHub! 👋
Hello! I'm a passionate developer and aspiring aerospace engineer, combining my love for technology and problem-solving. I focus on creating efficient solutions through programming, robotics, and data analysis. Here’s a snapshot of what I do:

💻 Programming
I’m proficient in Python and have worked on various projects, including simulations and web tools. One of my recent endeavors is an axis scale calculator designed to optimize graphing data for precision and space efficiency. I'm now integrating it into a web platform using JavaScript.

🤖 Robotics Enthusiast
As a robotics team leader, I’ve guided teams through technical challenges, helping younger members build their skills in engineering and programming. I enjoy solving complex problems and mentoring others in the process.

⚙️ Engineering & Data-Driven Solutions
With a strong interest in aerospace and physics, I’m always exploring new ways to apply real-world mechanics to technical innovation. Whether through simulations or robotics projects, I thrive on solving intricate problems using data and technology.

🌟 Ongoing Projects
Axis Scale Calculator: A Python-based tool for generating accurate graph scales, now being adapted for web use.
Robotics Mentorship: Continuing to mentor and lead projects in robotics, encouraging innovation and teamwork.
Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you’d like to collaborate!
